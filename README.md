Harish Yadav
Senior iOS Developer
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the iOS Developer position. With over 12.5 years of
experience in designing, developing, and delivering high-quality iOS applications, I am excited
about the opportunity to contribute my skills to a forward-thinking organization.
Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with Swift and Objective-C, building scalable and
high-performance mobile applications across enterprise, telecom, IoT, and consumer domains. I
have hands-on experience across the full iOS development lifecycle—from requirement analysis
and architecture design to App Store deployment and ongoing maintenance. I am particularly
skilled in modern iOS architectures such as MVVM and have collaborated closely with product
managers, designers, backend engineers, and QA teams in Agile environments.
In my recent roles, I have led feature development, improved application performance, integrated
APIs and SDKs, and mentored junior developers through code reviews and technical guidance. I
take pride in writing clean, testable code and in delivering reliable solutions that align with business
goals and user needs.
I am highly motivated, adaptable, and passionate about building impactful mobile products. I
believe my technical expertise, problem-solving mindset, and strong collaboration skills make me a
good fit for this role. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can add value to your team.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Harish Yadav
